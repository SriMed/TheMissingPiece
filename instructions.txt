Instructions: 
The Missing Piece is a game where a photo is concealed by a black screen and the player has to guess what the picture is.
The game is designed for one player.
For one player, there are a series of 20 questions which you must respond to. 
For levels 1 through 10, you will receive four options to select from, and you must click, with the mouse, the answer (button) you believe is correct. 
If the selected option is correct, you will receive ten points. If not, five points will be deducted.
From levels 11 to 20, you have five guesses. You must type your guess into the textfield which appears on the screen. 
There is one corrrect answer (capitalizations do NOT matter). 
Once you type the answer in the textfield, press the "Check" button once you finish typing your answer. 
Correct answers will be awarded 10 times the number of guesses you have left (thus, if you guess with 4 guesses remaining, you will receive 4 * 10 = 40 points).
The maximum number of points in levels 11 to 20 is 40 points.
